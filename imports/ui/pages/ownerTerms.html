            You are responsible for the entity listed on your page. In particular, this means that you must comply with all applicable laws and industry best practices when operating and promoting your entity, including obtaining all applicable licenses and approvals; ensure your content is lawful, correct, up-to-date and complete; and supply all required disclaimers, warnings, and notices (or if you rely on any supplied by Google, ensure their sufficiency for your entity). In addition, you must comply with the <a href="//www.google.com/intl/en/+/policy/content.html">Google+ User Content and Conduct Policy</a> and any other policies or guidelines listed in the <a href="#" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google+ Help Center</a> for verified businesses. These policies and guidelines become part of your agreement with us regarding these services.<br>
            <br />
            If we find in our discretion that youâ€™ve violated any of these responsibilities, we reserve the right to take the appropriate action. This means that in addition to the actions listed in the <a href="//www.google.com/intl/en/+/policy/pagesterm.html">Google+ Pages Additional Terms</a>, we may also de-verify your page or switch the verification status to another page.<br>
            <br />
            While Google is not responsible for your page or the entity listed on your page, once you verify, you understand that we have the right, but not the obligation, to moderate the content you supply via your page. Furthermore, we may not choose to display your content, may choose to show only an edited version of your content, or may choose to show content from an alternate source in place of your content.<br>
            <br />
            You also give Google a perpetual, irrevocable, worldwide, royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, adapt, modify, translate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display, distribute, and create derivative works of the basic listing information about your entity that you provide to your page (such as the entity name, location, phone number, category, hours, and website). You confirm and warrant to Google that you own or have all of the necessary rights or permissions to grant this license. You also grant to end users of Google services the right to access and use, including the right to edit, that information as permitted under the applicable Google terms of service. All other content that you provide to your page (such as business photos) is licensed to Google under the <a href="#">Google ToS</a>.
